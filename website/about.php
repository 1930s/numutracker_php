	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Information we collect; how we use it</h2>

<P>Automatically collected technical information: Our servers log information about each computer connecting with our site such as IP address, device characteristics, operating system, browser type, type of connection, page and file viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links. None of this automatically collected technical information is associated with any identified person at the time it is collected, but it could be associated with you under two circumstances: First, if you choose to give us personal data about you as described below, the technical information we collect that would otherwise be anonymous could instead be logged as coming from you; and second, if we are required to disclose our server logs as a result of a subpoena or other legal process, some third party such as your internet provider could match our anonymous technical information with you, using information beyond what is found on our servers.</P>

<P>We may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your computer, and we may partner with Google who may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser for statistics tracking.</P>

<P>Personal data you choose to give us: We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as username, email address, and listening information. We consider such personal data to be "Private Data," and subject to the "Personal Data Protection" paragraph below, with the following exception: Any data (text, images, videos, etc.) you post to a public forum on our site, linked to or from our site, or share via a social networking or promotional function, will not be considered "Private Data" and will not be subject to the "Personal Data Protection" paragraph below.</P>

<P><strong>Numu Tracker does not work with advertisers and does not sell information to any third parties under any circumstances.</strong></P>

<h2>Personal Data Protection</h2>

<P>Numu Tracker does not disclose to any third party Private Data you have given us. The only exception, obviously, is if we are forced to disclose the information as a result of a subpoena or other legal process. You may correct, amend, or delete inaccurate Private Data information you have given us. We take every reasonable precaution to protect your Private Data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your Numu Tracker account.</P>

<P>If you have any questions about our use of your Private Data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@numutracker.com">info@numutracker.com</a>.</P>

<P>We may revise our privacy policy from time to time by posting the changes here.</P>
