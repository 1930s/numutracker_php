# Numu Tracker Website 1.0

Quick and dirty web interface for Numu Tracker PHP.

There's a hat-tip to object oriented PHP, but this is still just a rough project thrown together in a weekend. Since this website isn't meant to be the main way to access Numu Tracker, and was built quickly, there is no login persistence and certain features missing from the iOS app.

Built August 2017.

As of March 6th, 2018, this is in production at https://www.numutracker.com

## To Install

1. Rename classes/example.database.php to classes/database.php and insert your db info.
2. Reference example.htaccess to update your own .htaccess to point all urls to index.php.
